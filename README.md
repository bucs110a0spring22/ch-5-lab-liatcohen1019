## SUMMARY:
This code programs three dart boards, the first a sample of what the board will look like with the darts getting on the board(purple), or off(pink). It then randomly generates a game between 2 players and indicated who wins depending on how many darts are made in the circle. Then part C provides a third board and asks for a number from the user, which then draws that number of darts on the board and uses the equation given in the code to estimate the number of pi using that amount of darts.
